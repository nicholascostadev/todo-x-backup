##  Ideas

Initial ideas for features to the project

- Should be able to have basic management of todos(creating, editing, marking as done, delete).
- Should be able to signup, login, recover password.
- Each person will have its own profile that can have public information as:
  - X total tasks done today.
  - Y total tasks done.
  - Z followers.
- Should be able to follow a user.

### Todo

- [x] Todos page
- [x] Add Todo
- [x] Mark Todo as done
- [x] Delete Todo
- [x] Login page(still with no server)
- [x] Signup page(still with no server)
- [ ] Register(fake register to begin with)
- [x] Login(fake login to begin with)
- [ ] Profile page(fake auth with localstorage)
- [ ] When server is ready: Transfer everything from local to server
